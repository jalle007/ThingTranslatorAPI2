            True to indicate that request comes from a device with a location sensor, otherwise false. 
            This information is required by Google and does not affect the results.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It is unclear if Google refers to the device performing the request or the source of the location data.
            In the geocoding API reference at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/ the definition is:
            
                sensor (required) — Indicates whether or not the geocoding request comes from a device with a location sensor.
            
            This implies that only mobile devices that are equipped with a location sensor (such as GPS) should set the Sensor value 
            to True. So if a location is sent to a web server which then calls the Google API, it apparently should set the Sensor
            value to false, since the web server isn't a location sensor equipped device.
            
            In another page of their documentation, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial they say:
            
                The sensor parameter of the URL must be included, and indicates whether this application uses a sensor (such as a GPS 
                locator) to determine the user's location.
            
            This implies something completely different, that the Sensor value must be set to true if the source of the location
            information is a sensor or not, regardless if the request is being performed by a location sensor equipped device or not.

            - For requests where the travel mode is transit: You can optionally specify one of departure_time or arrival_time. If neither time is specified, the departure_time defaults to now (that is, the departure time defaults to the current time).
            - For requests where the travel mode is driving: Google Maps API for Work customers can specify the departure_time to receive trip duration considering current traffic conditions. The departure_time must be set to within a few minutes of the current time.
            Note: Requests that include the departure_time parameter are limited to 100 elements
            Note: You can specify either DepartureTime or ArrivalTime, but not both

            The Google Places API is a service that returns information about a "place" (hereafter referred to as a Place) — defined within this API as an establishment, a geographic location, or prominent point of interest — using an HTTP request. Place requests specify locations as latitude/longitude coordinates.
            Two basic Place requests are available: a Place Search request and a Place Details request. Generally, a Place Search request is used to return candidate matches, while a Place Details request returns more specific information about a Place.
            This service is designed for processing place requests generated by a user for placement of application content on a map; this service is not designed to respond to batch of offline queries, which are a violation of its terms of use.

            A waypoint is specified as either a latitude/longitude coordinate or as an address which will be geocoded. (For more information on waypoints, see Using Waypoints in Routes below.)
            If you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, prefix the waypoint with 'via:'
            Waypoints prefixed with via: will not add an entry to the legs array, but will instead route the journey through the provided waypoint.
            The via: prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Google Maps Directions API.
            Caution: Using the via: prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are very strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This may result in severe detours on the route or ZERO_RESULTS in the response status code if the Google Maps Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.

        <member name="P:GoogleApi.Entities.Maps.Elevation.Request.ElevationRequest.Path">
            <summary>
            Sampled path requests are indicated through use of the path and samples parameters, indicating a request for elevation data along a path at specified intervals. As with positional requests using the locations parameter, the path parameter specifies a set of latitude and longitude values. Unlike a positional request, however, the path specifies an ordered set of vertices. Rather than return elevation data only at the vertices, path requests are sampled along the length of the path, based on the number of samples specified (inclusive of the endpoints).
            The path parameter may take either of the following arguments:
            An array of two or more comma-separated coordinate text strings separated using the pipe ('|') character: path=40.714728,-73.998672|-34.397,150.644
            Encoded coordinates using the Encoded Polyline Algorithm: path=enc:gfo}EtohhUxD@bAxJmGF
            Latitude and longitude coordinate strings are defined using numerals within a comma-separated text string. For example, "40.714728,-73.998672|-34.397, 150.644" is a valid path value. Latitude and longitude values must correspond to a valid location on the face of the earth. Latitudes can take any value between -90 and 90 while longitude values can take any value between -180 and 180. If you specify an invalid latitude or longitude value, your request will be rejected as a bad request.
            You may pass any number of multiple coordinates within an array or encoded polyline, as long as you don't exceed the service quotas, while still constructing a valid URL. Note that when passing multiple coordinates, the accuracy of any returned data may be of lower resolution than when requesting data for a single coordinate

            Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), 
            which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
            Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. 
            The Google Maps Geocoding API's reverse geocoding service also lets you find the address for a given place ID.
            The Google Maps Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request.

            <summary>
            Google Maps Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations using an HTTP request.
            You can search for directions for several modes of transportation, include transit, driving, walking or cycling. Directions may specify origins, 
            destinations and waypoints either as text strings (e.g. "Chicago, IL" or "Darwin, NT, Australia") or as latitude/longitude coordinates. 
            The Directions API can return multi-part directions using a series of waypoints.
            This service is generally designed for calculating directions for static (known in advance) addresses for placement of application content on a map; 
            this service is not designed to respond in real time to user input, for example. 
            For dynamic directions calculations (for example, within a user interface element), consult the documentation for the Google Maps JavaScript API Directions Service.
            Calculating directions is a time and resource intensive task. Whenever possible, calculate known addresses ahead of time (using the service described here) 
            and store your results in a temporary cache of your own design.

            Polyline encoding is a lossy compression algorithm that allows you to store a series of coordinates as a single string. Point coordinates are encoded using signed values. If you only have a few static points, you may also wish to use the interactive polyline encoding utility.
            The encoding process converts a binary value into a series of character codes for ASCII characters using the familiar base64 encoding scheme: to ensure proper display of these characters, encoded values are summed with 63 (the ASCII character '?') before converting them into ASCII. The algorithm also checks for additional character codes for a given point by checking the least significant bit of each byte group; if this bit is set to 1, the point is not yet fully formed and additional data must follow.
            Additionally, to conserve space, points only include the offset from the previous point (except of course for the first point). All points are encoded in Base64 as signed integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values. The encoding format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates representing latitude and longitude to a reasonable precision. Given a maximum longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places (180.00000 to -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed binary integer value.
            Note that the backslash is interpreted as an escape character within string literals. Any output of this utility should convert backslash characters to double-backslashes within string literals.
